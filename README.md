# Product List Application (Phase 2)

This project is a continuation of the Product List Application developed in Phase 1. In this phase, the application has been converted into a React application, leveraging component-based architecture and state management to enhance functionality and maintainability.

## Features

- **Component Structure**: The application is divided into reusable components, including `App.jsx` and `ProductList.jsx`.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's state to manage the current filter and the array of products.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can filter products by category using buttons, with the state being updated to reflect the selected filter.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Improved performance and responsiveness through React's virtual DOM and efficient rendering.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building user interfaces using components.
- **JavaScript**: For handling application logic and state management.
- **CSS**: For styling components and maintaining a responsive layout.
